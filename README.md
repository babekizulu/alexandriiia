## What is ALEXANDRiiiA?

### ALEXANDRiiiA, inspired by the Library of Alexandria, will render a simulated reconstruction of historical moments by combining multi agent task simulation, XR and ML models trained on historical data. The goals is to create immersive environments in which users can view interactions between AI agents trained on data which would help faciliate dialogue based on historical context and create multiple possible scenarios of how an historical event might have occurred.

# Technical Requirements:

## Multi Agent Task Simulation trained on historical data

## Historical Data Collection

## ML Models trained on Historical Data to script out multiple scenarios based on probability.

## XR, VR digital twin of historical locations

## 3D models of characters and civilians from this historical moment

# Development Phase:

## Research Phase
